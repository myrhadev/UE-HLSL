# UE-HLSL Shaders Collection

This repository contains a collection of custom HLSL shaders designed for use with Unreal Engine. These shaders are developed to enhance visual effects in Unreal Engine projects, offering a range of functionalities from simple visual enhancements to complex simulation of video compression artifacts.

## About HLSL Shaders

HLSL (High-Level Shader Language) is the shader language used by Unreal Engine to write shaders that can perform a variety of graphics rendering tasks. This collection leverages HLSL to create highly specialized shaders that can be used across different rendering stages in Unreal Engine.

## Included Shaders

Each shader in this collection serves a specific purpose. Here is a brief overview of what each shader file does:

- **ChromaSubsampling.usf**: Simulates chroma subsampling seen in videos.


## Usage

To use these shaders in your Unreal Engine project:
1. Clone this repository or download the desired `.usf` files.
2. Take the raw code from the .usf file, and use it in a 'Custom' code node in the Unreal shader editor.
